                    <h3>IT Technician at TAMUCC IT Department</h3>
                    <p class="subtitle">May 2024 to Aug 2025</p>
                    <p>I recently worked for the Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi (TAMUCC) IT department. 
                        On average, I set up two university employee workstations per week. About 4 out of every five devices I work with are Windows machines.
                        The other fifth are MacBooks. Over the past year, 
                        this has totaled to over 130 installations. On these installations, I frequently needed to employ 
                        troubleshooting skills to ensure employee devices and applications function properly.
                        When not fulfilling these duties, I worked to automate record-keeping processes with Python and Batch scripts
                        to improve office productivity.

                    <p>
                        I am currently preparing for the National Cyber League (NCL) competition with the Islander Cyber Society. 
                        This competition tests competitors on a variety of cybersecurity topics, including password cracking, network traffic analysis, and web application security. 
                        I am excited to compete in this competition and learn more about cybersecurity.

                    A long time hobby of mine is skateboarding. I like skateboarding because it's a good reason to get some fresh air, absorb some vitamin D from the sun, and do some cardio.
